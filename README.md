# Loan-repayment-risk-predictor
Loan repayment risk predictor is ML and DS based project which predicts the risk for lending loan to an user into 3 different categories: low risk , medium risk and high risk.

Initially we have 2 different datasets , one contains the data regarding loan amount , quantity , volume etc and the other contains data regarding user's region , district etc.

We first need to merge these both datasets on the basis of foreign key which in our case is creditor_id

To merge both datasets various options are available such using power query in excel , vlookup function etc.

Once dataset is ready , we perform eda , feature engineering and model building.

After doing model evaluation we choose best model for our dataset.
